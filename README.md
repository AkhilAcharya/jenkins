Using Jenkins for Continuous Integration


Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate the process of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). Here's how it works:

1.Set Up Jenkins: Install Jenkins on your server or local machine.

2.Configure Jenkins: Create a Jenkins job and link it to your GitHub repository.

3.Trigger Builds: Jenkins listens for changes in your repository. Whenever you push new code, Jenkins automatically triggers a build process.

4.Run Tests: Jenkins executes your predefined tests to ensure code quality.

5.Deploy: If all tests pass, Jenkins can automatically deploy your code to production or any other environment.



By integrating Jenkins with your GitHub repository, you can streamline your development workflow, catch bugs early, and deliver high-quality software faster.


For detailed setup instructions, refer to the Jenkins Documentation.
